Welcome to my personal website! I'm excited to have a dedicated space on the web to share my thoughts, projects, and discoveries.

## What You'll Find Here

This site serves several purposes:

- **Activity Feed**: A chronological stream of my latest updates, including blog posts, articles, and interesting projects
- **Blog**: In-depth technical articles and thoughts on technology, software engineering, and leadership
- **Publications**: A curated list of my academic or professional publications
- **About Me**: A brief introduction to who I am and what I do

## Why I Built This

In an era of social media fragmentation, having your own corner of the internet feels increasingly valuable. This site gives me:

1. **Ownership**: Full control over my content and how it's presented
2. **Permanence**: A stable home for my writing that won't disappear with the next platform shift
3. **Simplicity**: A clean, distraction-free space focused on content

## What's Next

I plan to share:

- Technical deep-dives on projects I'm working on
- Thoughts on software architecture and engineering practices
- Insights from my experience in technology leadership
- Interesting articles and resources I come across

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something useful here!
