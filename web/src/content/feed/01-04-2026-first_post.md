title: "First Post!"
summary: "This is the start of my personal website. I created this after attending a workshop by [Donn Felker](https://www.donnfelker.com/) on agentic coding. The workshop challenges you to create a project without using a single line of hand coding. In my case, this was easy as I have not worked on anything in a browser since it was common to write your own HTML and style sheets. It has been an extremeley useful exercise to get hands on with Claude Code, but I also look forward to having a small platform for sharing things that maybe I wouldn't on platforms like LinkedIn."
